				<p style="font-size: 20px"><span style="float: left; width: 0.7em; font-size: 400%; line-height: 80%; color: #FFB6C1;">T</span>he conventional American neighborhood seems to be disappearing — at least in Cupertino. Residents don’t crowd over lemonade stands, block parties aren’t held every week and neighbors don’t exactly bake each other apple pies. The wave of immigrants in Cupertino has replaced a lot of the traditional American culture. Yet, amidst all the change, garage sales, an old American tradition, have not disappeared from our community. <br><br>

Cupertino has been holding its annual city-wide Garage Sale since 1996. Originally, the event was created to prevent useful items from going to the landfill, but now, the Garage Sale weekend instills a sense of community between residents.
<br>
<br>In this interactive package, El Estoque tours the streets for Cupertino’s 20th annual city-wide Garage Sale and explores how garage sales have had an impact on our community, from reducing waste to bringing residents closer together to identifying the people behind the garage sale and the stories behind their objects.</p>

							<h3>Radar Detector</h3>
							<h4>The cordless radar detector was a gift from Denise Simmons’ brothers. It would tell the driver if there were any cops nearby, so the driver could slow down to the speed limit. The $80 detector was sitting on a table close to the sidewalk, next to an old-timey calculator and a few baseballs. Several years ago, the radar proved to be useful for Simmons, who would often get pulled over for speeding. <br><br>

“I never got speeding tickets again because I knew ahead of time that the cop was in the area,” she said. <br><br>

Now, because her car is so old, Simmons no longer needs it and included it in her garage sale for ten dollars.

							<h4>This upright retro vacuum was produced by a company under the name Kirby, and was made in the 1960s. The top portion of the vacuum holds the sack, which is made out of a light pink fabric with multiple deep brown “Kirby” logos on it. The bottom portion of the vacuum has a chrome finish with light pink inserts. <br><br>Arlene Boyd has used the vacuum for 15 to 20 years before retiring it. Boyd acquired the vacuum after the death of her husband’s mother. Since she now has a housekeeper, she no longer needs the vacuum. She decided to sell it, and let it continue its long journey. </h4>

							<h4>This band, at first sight, seemed like any normal metal cuff, but a deeper look at the green design on top revealed an engraving that said “A Century of Progress.” Laurine Hudson’s family has owned it ever since the Chicago World’s Fair in 1933, an international convention to promote all the new developments in technology. <br><br>
“You could get [this] at the World’s fair,” Hudson said.“You would get it at the gate when you bought your tickets.” <br><br>

The band was passed down in Hudson’s family and kept as a souvenir for the past 80 years.

According to Friend, he’s had it for only three weeks as an acquaintance traded it to him for some work he did over the past few weekends.

The jar was moved from the kitchen counter to the table almost 30 years after it was first bought from a department store. <br><br>
 “I made cookies once or twice and put them in there. Rest of the time it just sat on the counter looking nice,” Saunders said. <br><br>
Realizing that it was too fragile to use for cookies and not having any other use for it, she decided to put it out in this year’s garage sale.</h4>

It has been about 10 years since she  picked up the bowling pin. The pin, made of wood, has been used several times apparent from its numerous marks and dents.
